### 🗃️ Export (Backup) Your AniList — *Step-by-Step Details*

1. **Choose "Export your AniList (create a backup)" from the menu.**
   - The menu is fully boxed and colored for readability.
   - Type `-help` at any prompt for extra guidance.

2. **Enter your AniList username.**
   - The username prompt supports `-help` for instructions.
   - Only valid AniList usernames are accepted.
   - If you make a mistake, just try again.

3. **Choose if you want private entries included.**
   - If you select "No", only public entries are exported—no authentication needed!
   - If you select "Yes", follow the **OAuth authentication flow**:
     - **AniList API credentials required (Client ID & Secret):**
       - Step-by-step help messages guide you to [AniList Developer Settings](https://anilist.co/settings/developer).
       - Create a new client: Name="AniPort", Redirect URL="http://localhost".
       - Copy and paste your Client ID and Client Secret into the prompts.
     - AniPort generates an authorization URL. **Open in your browser, log in, and approve access.**
     - After approving, **copy the redirected URL from your browser’s address bar** and paste it back.
     - AniPort extracts the OAuth code and requests your token automatically.
     - Your OAuth token is securely saved locally for future use.

4. **Choose export type:**
   - Anime only, Manga only, or Both anime and manga.
   - The tool supports all combinations, with intelligent task assignment.

5. **Apply filters (optional):**
   - **Filter by status:** Choose one or more statuses by number or code (e.g., 1 3 or COMPLETED,DROPPED).
     - Status help and code mapping are always shown.
     - If no valid statuses are selected, the filter is skipped.
   - **Filter by title substring:** Enter any substring (case-insensitive) to match in titles.
     - Only entries whose title includes the substring are exported.

6. **Export process:**
   - AniPort fetches your anime/manga lists using the AniList GraphQL API.
   - All filters are applied before saving.
   - Progress bars show fetching and saving status.
   - Exports are saved in the `output/` folder as JSON files (`username_anime_backup.json`, etc.).
   - If both anime and manga are exported, a combined file is created.

7. **Summary and stats:**
   - At the end, AniPort displays how many entries were exported for each media type.
   - Time taken and export stats are shown in boxed, colored messages.

---

### 🔄 Import (Restore) a Backup — *Step-by-Step Details*

1. **Choose "Import from a backup (restore your list)" from the menu.**

2. **Select a backup JSON file:**
   - AniPort scans the `output/` folder for valid backups.
   - If only one backup is found, you can quickly confirm or enter another path.
   - If multiple backups are found, a menu lets you select one, or enter a custom path.
   - Robust error handling for invalid/missing files.

3. **Authenticate and choose the AniList account to restore to:**
   - AniPort supports multiple accounts!
   - Choose from saved accounts, add a new account, or remove accounts.
   - The interactive UI makes it easy to manage accounts and tokens.
   - If restoring private entries or using a new account, you’ll go through OAuth just like in Export.

4. **Account Verification:**
   - AniPort fetches "Viewer" info from AniList using your OAuth token.
   - The tool displays the authenticated username and ID for confirmation.
   - If the entered username does not match the token’s account, AniPort warns you and asks if you want to proceed.
   - This prevents accidental restores to the wrong account!

5. **Confirm restore:**
   - AniPort summarizes detected media types and entry count before restoring.
   - You must confirm before proceeding.

6. **Restore process:**
   - Each entry is imported using the SaveMediaListEntry mutation.
   - Progress bar shows the restore status.
   - Detailed stats (total, restored, failed, time taken) are shown at the end.

7. **Failed entries handling:**
   - Any failed restores are saved to a `.failed.json` file for easy retry.
   - AniPort prompts you to retry failed/missing entries instantly.
   - Multiple retries are supported.

8. **Verification:**
   - AniPort waits (with spinner/progress bar) before verifying entries—giving AniList time to update.
   - Verification checks only the imported media types and compares IDs.
   - Stats and messages show exactly how many entries matched.

9. **Post-verification tips:**
   - AniPort shows instructions for refreshing your AniList and making new entries visible (e.g., "Update Stats" on AniList list settings).

10. **Retry logic:**
    - If entries are still missing, AniPort saves them to a `.failed.json` again and offers further retries.

---

### ⚠️ AniList Authentication: What to Expect (Now Even More Explicit)

- **AniPort never asks for your AniList password.**  
- Private entries require OAuth authentication.
- You must create an AniList API client (one-time, free, and easy).
- Full step-by-step help at every prompt—type `-help` anytime.
- OAuth tokens are saved locally (`~/.aniport_accounts.json`) and can be deleted manually.
- AniPort always displays your authenticated username and ID before restoring, so you can avoid mistakes.

Verification complete!
Verification: 128 / 128 imported entries present in AniList (ANIME).
Note:
If you do not immediately see all your imported entries on AniList, don't worry!
AniList sometimes requires a manual refresh for new entries to appear in your list.
To update your list:
  1. Go to your AniList list settings page:
     https://anilist.co/settings/list
  2. Click on “Update Stats” and then “Unhide Entries.”
This will refresh your lists and make all imported entries visible.
You can also try refreshing your browser after doing this.

Verification PASSED: All imported entries are present in your AniList!
Your AniList should now match your backup!
